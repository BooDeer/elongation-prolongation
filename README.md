### This repository contains a collection of dumb and silly Chrome extensions I made during my free time for fun, some of them were made to learn something and others just because I was bored.

## [Facebookless](#)

##  Alot people are addicted to social medias, scrolling for several hours consuming content that's irrelevant and trivial, what's an easier way to reduce your facebook addiction than simply deleting its source, you can't scroll for hours if there's no content to scroll through, right?

	style="user-drag: none;
    -webkit-user-drag: none;
    user-select: none;
    -moz-user-select: none;
    -webkit-user-select: none;
    -ms-user-select: none;">

## [Color-Wheel](#)
## Everyone loves customization right? This extension allows you to make any web page you visit colorful the way you want it to be, choose the desired color and press the button to apply it, be warned though it may not look as beautiful as you imagined it in your head. 😉
